# MicroOCaml-Interpreter

This project simulates UTOP, a top level enviornment for OCaml. My MicroOCaml 
interpreter takes in user entered commands, uses the lexer to tokenize the input,
then uses the parser to check if the grammar of the input is valid, and finally
executes the command if the grammar is valid.
